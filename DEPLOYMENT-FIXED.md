# 🔧 GitHub Pages Deployment Fixed!

## ✅ Issues Resolved:

1. **Fixed Asset Path Issue**: Updated `vite.config.ts` to use correct base path for GitHub Pages
2. **Removed Missing CSS**: Cleaned up the missing `/index.css` reference
3. **Added Production Environment**: Set `NODE_ENV=production` in GitHub Actions
4. **Created Empty CSS File**: Added `public/index.css` to prevent 404 errors

## 🎯 What Was Changed:

### `vite.config.ts`:
- Added `base: '/securepass-ai/'` for GitHub Pages
- Set production environment detection

### `index.html`:
- Removed reference to missing `index.css`

### GitHub Actions:
- Added `NODE_ENV: production` to build step

## 🚀 Deployment Status:

Your site should now work correctly at: **https://iamaanahmad.github.io/securepass-ai/**

The GitHub Actions workflow is running and will deploy the fixed version automatically.

## ⚠️ Note About Tailwind CSS Warning:

The Tailwind CDN warning is normal for development. For production, consider installing Tailwind locally:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

But the CDN version works perfectly fine for this project!
